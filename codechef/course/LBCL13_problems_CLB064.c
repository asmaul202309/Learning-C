// If & Else Statements
// We use conditions in code for decision making and controlling the flow of a program.

// if and else keywords can be used together to create conditions.

// The syntax for this:

// if (condition) {
//     // code to run if the condition is true
// } else {
//     // code to run if the above condition is false
// }
// Condition can be any expression which you are trying to evaluate. A simple condition can be:

// int a = 4;
// int b = 5;
// if (a == b) {
//     printf("a and b are equal");
// } else {
//     printf("a and b are not equal");
// }

// // Output:
// // a and b are not equal
// a == b is used to check whether the values of variables a and b are equal. == is called a equal to operator.

// Here's a table of common operators used in C conditions:

// Operator	Description	Example
// ==	Equal to	a == b
// !=	Not equal to	a != b
// >	Greater than	a > b
// <	Less than	a < b
// >=	Greater than or equal to	a >= b
// <=	Less than or equal to	a <= b
// Task
// Write a program which does the following

// Let's think of a real-life example where we need to find out if a person is old enough to vote.
// Find out if the age (25) is greater than OR equal to the voting age limit, which is set to 18.
// Declare the variables age and vage - and initialize them to the values 25 and 18 - i.e. the age and the voting age respectively.
// Compare age and vage using the syntax given above and output the following
// "Old enough to vote!" if age is greater than or equal to vage
// "Not old enough to vote." if age is lesser than vage

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    int voting_age =18;
    
    if (age>= voting_age) {
        printf("Old enough to vote!");
    } else {
        printf("Not old enough to vote.");
    
}
}
